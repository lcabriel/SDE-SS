# Test Codes:

In this repository, there are some tests code that can help you to understand how to use the library at its full potential.
For a wider documentation about the functions please look to the README of the Core directory.

At this moment, there are the following test codes:

- *test_code.cpp*: the first test code. This file is made to teach you how to use the basic features of SDE-SS and program your own SDE system.
- *test_code_data.cpp*: this test code is made to show how to use the Data Linkers to implement forcing factors based on data.
- *test_code_noiseplugs.cpp*: this test code is made to show how to use the NoisePlugs to implement fastly elements for certain structured noises (e.g. Wiener Process).
