In this example we will show you how to implement a field where the data linker is needed. To do this we are going to implement a system to 
produce a trajectory and another one then based on a data linker.

//######################################################### FIELD TO PRODUCE THE DATA ##################################################################################
/*1. We need at first to create our production field. To do this we need to create a custom version of the Field class. Defining as variable all 
the parameters we are going to use.

2. In the construction we need also to pass the noise. The class is made to accept any NoiseClass object however NoiseClass is purely virtual.
You can create one of your own looking to the standard ones defined in "SDE-SS.cpp" however the Gaussian White noise is already implemented both
using the Euler-Maruyama method and the Milstein one. They are called "WienerEuler" and "WienerMilstein". 
To set the Noise properly we suggest to use the internal FieldClass function "setNoise".

3. A generic system of SDEs can be written in Ito's formula as

        dx = f(x,t)dt + g(x,t)dW

If the noise is colored can be thought most of the time in this way supposing to add a dimension to define the noise propeties.
For other kinds of noises which cannot be expressed in this way, you are free to create your own class or, please, send it to us as a suggestion.
Coming back, the FieldClass is created around the Ito's formula thus we need to characterised the f(x,t) and g(x,t), to do this you need to override the
"f_function_impl" and "g_function_impl" as in the example.
